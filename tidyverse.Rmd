# Welcome!

This tutorial is partly based on the book "R for Data Science" which is freely available here: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

## What do you need to follow along?

## Why data manipulation and visualization?

The core component of any data analytics project is **data**. Understanding and manipulating data is crucial to:

- Define the scope of a project: know what is possible with the current data, etc.
- Prepare different data workflows. Data is rarely usable in raw form, some transformations need to be applied to it before modelling. *Garbage in, garbage out!*.
- Present the results. Every analysis we do needs to have a **why**. Very often the outcome of this analysis needs to be communicated to decision makers or non-experts.

In this course we will use the `tidyverse`, which is a coherent set of packages for the full lifecycle of a data science project. 

Let's import the `tidyverse` library, which is a wrapper for all eight packages (as of 2018).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

If this is not installed in your system, you need to `install.packages("tidyverse")` first.

# Data manipulation with `dplyr`


We turn now to `dplyr`. This package provides a function for each basic action with data: 

- `filter()` (and `slice()`)
- `arrange()`
- `select()` (and `rename()`)
- `distinct()`
- `mutate()` (and `transmute()`)
- `summarise()`
- `sample_n()` (and `sample_frac()`)

which can do many things together with the "%>%" (read "and then")


We will use the [Online News Popularity](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) data. 

Let's start by loading it, and keep only a part:

```{r}
news<-read.csv("OnlineNewsPopularity.csv")[2:5]
head(news) # Too many columns

```


We can use some base `R` functions to understand a bit what is going on:

```{r}
table(news$data_channel_is_lifestyle)
```
Or even something like this:


```{r}
table(news$data_channel_is_lifestyle, news$data_channel_is_bus)
```

But as we will see, things get messy when the questions to our data become harder!

Let's say we want the articles from a specific day:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Filter the articles from a specific day
oldest <- dplyr::filter(news, timedelta == 731 )
head(oldest, n = 2)
```
or, using the operator %>%:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
news %>% dplyr::filter(timedelta==731) %>% head(n=2)
```

In pure R (without dplyr), we can do

```{r, echo = TRUE}
oldest <- news[news$timedelta==731,]
head(oldest, n = 2 )
```

###  filter()
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Filter the articles from a specific day
oldest <- dplyr::filter(news, timedelta == 731 )
head(oldest, n = 2)

```

or, using the operator %>%:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
news %>% dplyr::filter(timedelta==731) %>% head(n=2)
```

In pure R (without dplyr), we can do

```{r, echo = TRUE}
oldest <- news[news$timedelta==731,]
head(oldest, n = 2 )
```

###  slice()

slice() filters rows by position, for instance:
```{r, echo = TRUE}

slice(news, 16:20)

```

###  arrange()

arrange() orders columns and helps to break ties.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

news %>%
  arrange(timedelta, n_tokens_title, n_tokens_content) %>% 
  head(n=3)

```

We can use desc() to arrange a column in descending order.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
news %>% 
  arrange(desc(timedelta), n_tokens_title, n_tokens_content) %>% 
  head(n=3)
```


###  select()

We can use select to, well, select specific columns:

```{r, echo = TRUE}

news %>% select(timedelta,n_tokens_content) %>% head(n=2)

```


```{r, echo = TRUE}
news %>% select(-c(n_tokens_title,n_tokens_content)) %>% head(n=2)

```

We can use select() also to rename columns
```{r, echo = TRUE}
news %>% select(words_in_title = n_tokens_title) %>% head(n=3)
```

###  rename()
This is useful to rename a column without dropping the other variables

```{r, echo=TRUE}

news %>% rename(words_in_title = n_tokens_title) %>% head(n=3)
```

###  distinct()

This function allows us to find unique values in a table
```{r, echo=TRUE}
news %>% distinct(timedelta) %>% head(n=3)

```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
news %>% distinct(timedelta,n_tokens_title) %>% nrow

```

###  mutate()
Sometimes we need to add new columns that are function of existing columns, for instance:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
news %>% 
  mutate(title_to_content = n_tokens_title/n_tokens_content
         ,total_unique = n_tokens_content * n_unique_tokens ) %>% 
  head(n=3)

```

We can recycle newly created variables!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
news %>% 
  mutate(title_to_content = n_tokens_title/n_tokens_content
         ,percentage = round(100*title_to_content,2) ) %>% 
  head(n=3)

```


###  transmute()
Like mutate(), but keeps only the newly created variables


```{r, echo=TRUE}
news %>% 
  transmute(title_to_content = n_tokens_title/n_tokens_content
         ,total_unique = n_tokens_content * n_unique_tokens ) %>% 
  head(n=3)

```


### Sampling: sample_n() and sample_frac()
These two functions allow us to sample randomly a fixed number of rows or a fraction. Use replace = TRUE for a sample with replacement, and you can add weights for the sampling if needed. More info in ?sample_n

### Grouping functions

All the functions above become really useful when we can apply them to groups. Let's load again the data, this time the full data frame:

```{r}
news<-read.csv("OnlineNewsPopularity.csv")
```



```{r, echo=TRUE}
gps <- news %>% 
  sample_frac(.1)%>%
  group_by(data_channel_is_lifestyle
          ,data_channel_is_world)%>%
  summarise(count=n()
            ,avg_imgs = mean(num_imgs, na.rm = TRUE)
            , avg_videos =mean(num_videos, na.rm = TRUE)) 

```

### Plotting the final results

```{r, echo=TRUE}
barplot(gps$avg_imgs
        , names.arg = c("Other", "Lifestyle", "World")
        , main = "Average number of images")
```


### Another useful plot 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(news$timedelta,news$shares
     , type='l', main = "Number of shares across time"
     , xlab = "Days since acquisition", ylab = "Number of shares")

```

Let's test some hypothesis:

- What are the 5 most shared articles?
- Which channel (among the six described) has the largest average number of shares? does it change across time?
- Which day has the most shares, on average?


What are the 5 most shared articles?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
news %>% arrange(desc(shares)) %>% select(url,shares) %>% head(n=5)
```

Which channel has the largest number of shares?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ex2a <- news %>% 
  group_by(data_channel_is_lifestyle
  , data_channel_is_entertainment
  , data_channel_is_bus
  , data_channel_is_socmed
  , data_channel_is_tech
  , data_channel_is_world)%>% 
  summarise(avg_shares = mean(shares))
  
```
... and the plot:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
barplot(ex2a$avg_shares,
        names.arg =c("Other","LS","Ent","Bus","SM","Tech","World"))


```

Does it change with time?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ex2b <- news %>% dplyr::filter(data_channel_is_world ==1) 

plot(ex2b$timedelta,ex2b$shares
     , type='l', main = "Number of shares across time- World"
     , xlab = "Days since acquisition", ylab = "Number of shares")

```

Which day has the most shares, on average?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ex3 <- news %>% 
  group_by(weekday_is_monday
  , weekday_is_tuesday
  , weekday_is_wednesday
  , weekday_is_thursday
  , weekday_is_friday
  , weekday_is_saturday
  , weekday_is_sunday)%>% 
  summarise(avg_shares = mean(shares))
```

and the plot:

```{r,echo = TRUE}
  
barplot(ex3$avg_shares,
        names.arg =c("Mon", "Tue",'Wed', "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))


```


# Data Visualization with `ggplot2`

We will use as our running example the `mpg` data set available with the `tidyverse`.

Let's take a look first:

```{r}
head(mpg)
```

This data set contains information about different cars. For more info on what these variables mean, try `?mpg`.


## Baseline: Base R charts

Suppose we want to plot the highway miles per gallon (`mpg$hwy`) as a function of engine displacement (`mpg$displ`). `R` comes with basic plotting functionality. We could do this, for instance, with the following command:


```{r}
plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy)
```

This is of course, ugly. We can add some formatting to make it nicer. 

```{r}
plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy, 
     main="Performance as a function of engine displacement", 
     xlab ="Engine displacement", ylab="Fuel performance", 
     col='red')
```

How did I know this commands? Simply use `?plot` to display the help on the side menu in RStudio. That's fine for a simple plot, but when we are doing data exploration (aka Exploratory Data Analysis), this is not always efficient.

## The grammar of graphics

`ggplot2` instead implements a **grammar of graphics**. This is a structured way to create graphs. There are two basic constructs on a `ggplot2` chart:

  - **plot**: that's the coordinate system(s) with the source data.
  - **layer**: each of the possible representation of the data.

Each layer has:

- **Data**: No need to explain this one.
- **Geometry**: Geometry of the data (points, lines, bars).
- **Aesthetics**: Visual property of the data. 

So, a plot is the canvas on which we paint, the layer is the things we paint there.

For example:

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy))
```

The first command `ggplot(data=mpg)` creates the coordinate system with an empty chart. We add to this chart a layer where the data is mapped to the axis and represented with the given geometry (`geom_point`).

We can add some color per class:

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy)
             , color="red")+
  labs(x="Engine displacement", y="Fuel performance"
       , title="Performance as a function of engine displacement")+
  theme_bw()
  
```

Ok, so what? We have a different way to make the same plot, but that's not really useful nor terribly interesting. Let's ignore that for a second and observe that, while there is a decreasing trend (the performance decreases as the engine displacement increases), there are a few outlier points. Why would that be? Let's change **one single line** of the previous code to add color by car type.

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))+
  labs(x="Engine displacement", y="Fuel performance"
       , title="Performance as a function of engine displacement")+
  theme_bw()
```


Now we have a much more informative chart! We see that those outlierish points correspond to cars with two seats (sports cars).

Note that we had to change the aesthetics: the color corresponds to the class, instead of being uniformly applied to the chart.

This is better, but still a bit crowded. How about splitting this chart in several charts per class? We can do that with the `facet_wrap()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))+
  labs(x="Engine displacement", y="Fuel performance"
       , title="Performance as a function of engine displacement")+
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow=2)+
  theme_bw()
```

Do you want to save your masterpiece? `ggsave('myfile.png')` will do.


## Beyond scatter plots

We can replace the `geom_point()` object with other types, for instance

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy))
```

Note however that not all aesthetics can be applied to all geometries. Now this is the part where `ggplot2` shines: You can put several layers together!

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy))
```

Note that there's a small detail with this: if you wanted to change the `y` variable, now you have to do changes in two layers, not only in one. To prevent that, you can specify the mapping on the `ggplot` function instead, so that it would be treated as a *global* mapping that applies to each layer.

For instance,

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy))+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=class))+
  geom_smooth()
```


## Statistical transformations

We can do groupings per category. For instance, let's see how many cars do we have from each class:

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class))
```

Note that here we are not plotting the "raw" values that come in our data. Rather, we are doing aggregates **and then** plotting such values. Other graphs also calculate new values:

- Bar charts, histograms and other frequency polygons bin your data and then plot the number of elements that fall in each bin.
- Smoothers fit a model (`geom_smooth()` for instance).
- Boxplots/violinplots compute a special statistical plot.

Another way of doing the previous chart is using the `stat_count` function explicitly:

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x=class))
```



Every `geom_` has a default `stat_` associated to it. Sometimes we need to override it: 


```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~class,         ~count,
   "2seater",        5,
 "compact",       47,
 "midsize",       41,
 "minivan",       11,
 "pickup",        33,
 "subcompact",    35,
 "suv",           62
)

ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class, y = count), stat = "identity")
```

When the data is already summarized, as in the example above, we need to override the default `stat_` that comes with `geom_bar`, namely, `stat_count`.

Sometimes you do not have the data aggregated, but you want to override the default count to get a proportion chart instead. In that case, you can do the following:

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class, y=..prop.., group=1))
```

You can also look at the different variations within each class:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x=class, y=hwy), 
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```


## Position adjustments

We can color bar charts too, using either `color`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class, color=drv))
```

or `fill`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class, fill=drv))
```

The bars get in this case stacked. This is not great because the bars end up covering each other. We can make them visible by making the bars slightly transparent:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class, fill=drv), alpha=0.2, position = "identity")
```



Or, we can control the position:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class, fill=drv), position = "fill")
```

We can also put them side by side:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class, fill=drv), position = "dodge")
```


## Exercises

Using the `diamonds` data set, reproduce the charts below. You might find it handy to get a copy of [RStudio's Data Visualization Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ggplot2)

```{r,echo=F}
diamonds %>%
ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(factor(cut), price, fill=cut)) + 
  ggtitle("Diamond Price according Cut") + 
  xlab("Type of Cut") + 
  ylab("Diamond Price USD") + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,7500))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_violin(aes(factor(color), (price/carat), fill=color)) + 
  ggtitle("Diamond Price per Carat according Color") + 
  xlab("Color") + ylab("Diamond Price per Carat USD")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=diamonds) + 
  geom_density(aes(x=price, group=cut, fill=cut), adjust=1.5)

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=diamonds) + 
  geom_density(aes(x=price, group=cut, fill=cut), adjust=1.5 , alpha=0.2)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=diamonds) + 
  geom_density(aes(x=price, group=cut, fill=cut), adjust=1.5, position="fill")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot()+
  scale_color_hue()+
  geom_point(aes(x=carat,
             y=price,
             color=color))+
  facet_wrap(~cut)
```


# Strings and text with `stringr` and `tidytext`


The `stringr` package consists of functions for:

- Character manipulation in strings.
- Whitespace tools (add, remove and manipulate whitespace).
- Pattern matching functions, like regular expressions.

## Introduction to stringr

We can get the length of a string:

```{r}
str_length("Machine learning")
```

and get a part of it:

```{r}
s <- c("Machine learning")
str_sub(s, 1, 4)
```
We can also use this function to modify strings:

```{r}
str_sub(s, 8,8) <- "-"
s
```

There are also functions to modify whitespace:

```{r}

short_long <- c("a short", "and a long string")
str_pad(short_long, 20)
```

In this example, whitespace was added to have all strings of the same length.

To truncate strings:

```{r}
str_trunc(short_long, 8)
```

Sometimes we do not want to add whitespace, but rather remove it:

```{r}
test <- c(" A lot of whitespace   ")
str_trim(test, "left")
```

and from the right:

```{r}
str_trim(test,"right")
```
Sometimes it is useful to have the same case (upper/lowercase):

```{r}
str_to_upper(test)
```

Similarly, `str_to_lower()` and `str_to_title()` can be used for lowercase and title (first letter of each word is capitalized). 

### Pattern matching

```{r}
fruits <- c("mango", "coconut", "grape", "pear")
str_view(fruits, "an") 
```


We can use `.` to match any character:

```{r}
str_view(fruits, 'pe.')
```

The `.` has then a special use. This is a bit unfortunate, since we sometimes need to match it. We then have to use a special escape character, `\\.`, since `\` is also reserved. For instance:

```{r}
urls <- c("seznam.cz", "google.com", "facebook.com")
str_view(urls, "\\.")
```

By default, regular expressions match any part of the string, but we can force it to anchor the beginning or end using the symbols `^` and `$`.

```{r}
str_view(fruits, '^m')
```


Other separators include:

- `\d:` matches any digit.
- `\s:` matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
- `[abc]:` matches a, b, or c.
- `[a-z]`: matches lowercase letters.
- `[A-Z]`: matches uppercase letters.
- `[^abc]:` matches anything except a, b, or c.
- `?`: appears 0 or 1 times
- `+`: appears 1 or more times
- `*`: appears 0 or more times

We can also specify the number of matches:

- `{n}`: exactly n matches
- `{n,}`: n or more matches
- `{,m}`: at most m matches
- `{n,m}`: between n and m matches

For instance, let's extract emails:

```{r}
text <- c("info@datastart.eu", "webmaster@cvut.cz", "bacon")
str_view(text, '[a-z]{4,10}@[a-z]{4,10}\\.[a-z]{2,}')

```

This is of course a somewhat simplified version, since email addresses can be more complicated, see [here](http://emailregex.com/) for instance. 


## Practice!

Let's use the `words`, `sentences` and `fruits` datasets included in `stringr`. Use the function `str_detect`.

- Find all words that start or end with x (in `words`, this and the next three exercises).
- Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
- Are there any words that contain at least one of each vowel?
- What word has the highest proportion of vowels? 
- What are the five most common words in `sentences`?
- How many fruits begin with a vowel?




# Putting all together


We are ready to come back to the news data set:

```{r}
news<-read.csv("OnlineNewsPopularity.csv")
```

You will need to combine the tools from this tutorial to solve the following questions. You should do a visualization, whenever relevant.

- Plot the distribution of shares per weekday and per category (hint: facets).
- What article has the highest number of shares on each category?
- Extract the title of the articles from the url. 
- Which brand is more mentioned? Apple or Samsung?
